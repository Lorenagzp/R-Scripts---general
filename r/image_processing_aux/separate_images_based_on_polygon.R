## Script to get the images corresponding to the area inside a polygon from a folder.
## Assuming the Coordinate system of the geotagg is WGS84
## For RedEdge camera imagery, may need tuning for other metadata structure,i.e. select the name of the lat long columns
## Warning: If there are repeated filenames in subfolders they will not be copied, because they will all be copied to one folder.You can run separately subfolders with identical filenames.
