## Script to get the images corresponding to the area inside a polygon from a folder and separate images from fidderent dates inside same ROI in different folders.
## Assuming the Coordinate system of the geotagg is WGS84
## For RedEdge camera imagery and any other
## Recursively searches pictures inside subfolders (recursive = TRUE)
## November 2019
############################issues known:
## + Check the "date" column name" to make sure that is the date you want to consider (eg. modify, create, update date...)
## + The metadata field names are fixed, may need adjusting to every specific case.
## + If the camera stopped capturing unexpetectedly, a metadata issue can rise because there will be NA values in the table
